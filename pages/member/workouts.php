                        <p>Instead of punching in your usual routine on a cardio machine, push yourself further by
                            programming in short bouts of vigorous exercise. When you know the higher-intensity exercise
                            has an end in sight, you tend to work harder, boosting calorie burn and speeding up results.
                            It works whether you want to lose weight or get in better shape.

                        <p>Not only does standing around between toning exercises eat up valuable gym time, it can make
                            your workouts less effective. To rev up your weight-room routine, try training on a circuit.
                            This combination of cardio and resistance training forces you to work harder.

                        <p>You can generate the most power with barbell lifts, so the standard barbell bench allows you
                            to move the most weight. It's also an easier lift to control than pressing with heavy
                            dumbbells. The exercise is easy to spot and relatively easy to learn (if not master), There
                            are plenty of bench-press programs you can follow to increase your strength</p>
